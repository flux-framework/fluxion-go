Fluxion Go are the Go bindings for the flux scheduler [flux-framework.org/flux-sched](https://github.com/flux-framework.org/flux-sched) that we call "fluxion." You can read more about the project there. In short, you might want to use these bindings if you're interested in integrating the flux scheduler logic (graph-based, hierarchical scheduling) into your Go applications.
